The code of the CMU method

The "CMU method.m" file shows how to use the CMU method. The “LRF_TriLCI” and "TriLCI" files can be found in another project. Everyone is welcome to use the code for research work, but not for commerce. If you use the code, please cite my paper(  @ARTICLE{11145875,

Before you use the code, you need to calculate the point cloud resolution (pr).
